readme for AlpacaEmblem.

the following document explains the implementation of the code for a small game, called Alpaca Emblem.

combat(): it's an Unit's method, that given an Unit sets the conditions for a combat to begin. These are, units are in range of the equipped Item, and both units have positive currentHitpoints. After this this method calls a second method called attack.

attack(): it's an unit's method. When it is called one unit attacks the other with  its equippedItem. This method won't work if the unit that attacks does not have an equipeditem.


To fix the method that equips items to the units (equipItem), a double Dispatch was implemented, by setting methods in the abstract classes, abstractItem and abstracMagicBook.Each one of this two classes has an method called equipTo+"unit"  for each unit, and receives the units that corresponds.
This process was also used to fix the combat between units.(to see how an units attacks other).

Other method that was created was Heal, this method only works it it is called by a cleric. if it is the case, and the cleric has an Staff equipped, it will heal an unit. If the unit reaches its maxHitPoints, the method will stop.

Also some methods like getMaxHitPoints and setHitPoints were included to make the combat between units easier.


Besides the methods, it was implemented some new classes. These were lightMagicBook(equipableItem), Sorcerer(IUnit), animaMagicBooks(equipableItem) and DarknessMagicBook(equipableItem).


To run the game it is needed to create a gameField. To make this it is needed to add locations and conect them (it it is the case)

Then the units and the items must be created.

In the near future, as the game gets developed, more instructions will be given.

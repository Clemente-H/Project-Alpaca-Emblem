readme for AlpacaEmblem.

the followind document explains the implementation of the code for a small game.

combat(): it's an Unit's method, that given an Unit sets the conditions for a combat to begin. These are, units are in range of the equiped Item, and both units have positive currentHitpoins. After this this method calls a second method called attack.

attack(): it's an unit's method. When it is called one unit attacks the other with  its equipedItem. This method won't work if the unit that attacks does not have an equipeditem.


To fix the method that equips items to the units (equipItem), a double Dispatch was implemented, by setting methods in the abstrac classes, abstracItem and abstracMagicBook.Each one of this two classes has an method called equipto+"unit"  for each unit, and recives the units that corresponds.
This proces was also used to fix the combat between units.(to see how an units attacks other).

Other method that was created was Heal, this method only works it it is called by a cleric. if it is the case, and the cleric has an Staff equiped, it will heal an unit. If the unit is reaches it maxHitPoints, the method will stop.

Also some methods like getMaxHitPoints and setHitpoints were included to make the combat between units easier.


Besides the methods, it was implemented some new classes. These were lightMagicBook(equipableItem), Sorcerer(IUnit), animaMagicBooks(equipableItem) and DarknessMagicBook(equipableItem).
